A place to store all byte-sized projects designed to learn new things and regularly write software however useless it might be

## Ground rules

1. List all project in this file

## Projects

1. [ ] **FTP client implementation:**

    Use Elixir or C#

2. [x] **Bubble sort:**

    Classic simple algorithm for sorting iterables

    [python implementation](/bubble-sort-python/), elixir implementation pending

3. [x] **Selection sort**

    The first item in the unsorted partition is compared with all the values to the right-hand side to check if it is the minimum value. If it is not the minimum value, then its position is swapped with the minimum value.

4. [x] **Insertion sort**

    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
