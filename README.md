# Quickies

A place to store all byte-sized projects designed to learn new things and regularly write software however useless it might be

## Ground rules

1. List all project in this file

## Projects

1. [ ] **FTP client implementation:**

    Use Elixir or C#

2. [x] **Bubble sort:**

    Classic simple algorithm for sorting iterables

    [python implementation](/bubble-sort-python/), elixir implementation pending

3. [x] **Selection sort**

    The first item in the unsorted partition is compared with all the values to the right-hand side to check if it is the minimum value. If it is not the minimum value, then its position is swapped with the minimum value.

4. [ ] **Quick sort**

5. [ ] **Cocktail shaker sort**

    Bubble sort version but optimized

6. [ ] **Learning Elixir simple projects**

7. [ ] **Uptime robot for telegram**

8. [ ] **Cryptopals challenges**

9. [ ] **SHA encoder**

10. [ ] **JSON parser**

11. [ ] **Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol**

## To-Do

- performance tests for every project where it makes sense
